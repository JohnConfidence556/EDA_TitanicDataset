# EDA_TitanicDataset

## Project Overview 
The objective of the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project on the Titanic dataset is to:

-Explore and understand the characteristics of passengers on the Titanic, including their survival rates, demographic information, and travel details.

- This objective can be broken down into several key aspects:

- Survival Rates: Analyze the proportion of passengers who survived and those who did not, and identify any patterns or trends in survival rates.

- Demographic Information: Examine the demographic characteristics of passengers, such as age, sex, passenger class, and explore how these factors relate to survival rates.

- Travel Details: Investigate travel-related factors like ticket fare, cabin class, and embarkation point to see if they have any impact on survival rates.

- Insights and Recommendations; Draw conclusions based on the findings and provide recommendations for further analysis or potential applications.

By achieving this objective, the project aims to gain a deeper understanding of the Titanic passenger data, identify key factors influencing survival rates, and uncover valuable insights that can inform future research or applications.
